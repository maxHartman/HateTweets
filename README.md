# HateTweets: *An Investigative Machine Learning Project in Hate Speech on Twitter*

## Background
In the space of cyber hate speech detection, much research has been done to determine effective methods for discerning and classifying online hate messages. However, one major challenge that has yet to be addressed involves generalizing said methods across various types of data. Be it different years, different events, or different “types” of hate speech, current studies have investigated on only a subset of the myriad forms of online hate speech detection. Thus, the question we ask is: how well do state-of-the-art methods perform and generalize when training classifiers on different types of cyber-hate data?

The code in this repository is what we used in our investigation.

## About Us
We are 3 Engineering Master's candidates at the University of Pennsylvania. This work was done to fulfil a final project for CIS 519: Applied Machine Learning. The course website with the project requirements can be found [here](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis519/fall2019/project.html).

## Notes
Some of this code pertains to datasets we are unable to publish due to confidentiality agreements with researchers. We have only included the datasets that are publicly available. These datasets and associated files are not our own.
